I went through [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100) by Paul Hudson the creator of [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/). The free collection of videos, tutorials and tests teaches Swift beginners a huge collection of different topics across the board. If you are looking for an overview  in Swift to get your iOS development going, I highly recommend this course. It is setup to take about 1 hour a day for 100 days. It is definitely worth the work!
